[Mini Word Tool](https://zromick.github.io/mini-word-tool): A minimalistic word frequency counter and proper noun replacement tool. Currently building this to allow editors to change real names to fictional names throughout large texts.

[yt-frame-timer](https://slashinfty.github.io/yt-frame-timer/): Came up with this idea in December of 2018 to help speedrun.com moderators retime more accurately and quickly. I contributed a bit of JS code to the project.
