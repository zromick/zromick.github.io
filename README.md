Check out my projects!

[Conway's Game of Life](https://zromick.github.io/conways-game-of-life): A simulation of Conway's Game of Life. Built using minimalistic React and Material-UI code.

[Mini Word Tool](https://github.com/zromick/Mini-Word-Tool): A minimalistic word frequency counter and proper noun replacement tool. Currently building this to allow editors to change real names to fictional names throughout large texts.

[yt-frame-timer](https://slashinfty.github.io/yt-frame-timer/): Came up with this idea in December of 2018 to help speedrun.com moderators retime more accurately and quickly. I contributed a bit of JS code to the project.
